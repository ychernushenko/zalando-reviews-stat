Cautiously wore them for the first time to do an easy paced 6 mile run without any problems, next run was 15 miles and again no rubbing or chaffing. I've also worn them since for speed sessions and they're fine. There's a definite difference between Pegasus and Vomero; Vomero being more cushioned. Incidentally I wear customised insole orthotics in my running shoes, these shoes come with an OK cushioned insole which would be OK for a little while but if you're a serious runner orthotics are the way to go. They're true to size, toe box is slightly more spacious than Pegasus (I'm a tiny 2.5 UK and find it problematic finding show to fit) Also, love the colour, especially the lovely bright orange laces.

The soles have deep tread pattern and are tough, not showing any marks after about 30 miles mixed trekking.\\nThe fit is excellent, unusually adaptive to my narrow feet.  This is due to the flexible upper and long lacing pattern right down the top surface. I nearly threw the extra, optional, insoles beacause they were packed in an unmarked white box which looked like a spacer. They are a good idea, but I didn't need them as the boot accommodated well to my foot. The construction of the boot looks robust, with the top lacing anchorage made of steel tied back to the heel, and various  re-inforcement strips and mouldings . The boot is light , has been completely waterproof. It's easy to put on and take of provided that the laces are released down the foot.   \\nIt was comfortable immediately, and if it wears as well at it promises, it will be my standard footwear.\",\n",

This lightweight wheeled suitcase is no different, lots of zipped compartments and extras to stow your magazines, front pocket for carrying your airline tickets etc whilst around the airport.  It looks small when you look at it, but it's like a blackhole in the amount you can actually fit into it & the compression straps are helpful.  I also have the osprey large rucksack that zips up the harness which I use for backpacking around & I use the airporter bag which I stash my rucksack in & i'll use this too to keep this bag protected (I have seen how baggage handlers treat suitcases).\\nReally impressed with this bag as I am with all Osprey kit (& no I don't work for them!). \",\n",

Before I ordered these I called customer care to make sure I ordered the size I needed to get a US 8, was told to order a UK6, I did and a 38.5 arrived another US 7.5 I returned the shoes and re ordered them from another supplier.

My first impression was that the material feels very thin: it&#39;s not a cosy cardigan, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for. Also, there&#39;s not much stretch to the material, so it&#39;s awkward to wear over other tops. It does look quite smart on though, and the pockets are a nice feature. ',\n",

       "  'Text': 'The most comfortable shoes on the market. The boost sole is squishy under foot, soft to stand on all day &amp; the boost technology gives an everlasting spring to each step. There quite a good degree of heel to toe angle. There is some arch support which is fine for me but if you are looking for more arch support then the ultra boost ST models might be better. The sole is made from continental so traction is superior in all weather. The insoles are removable and do have an nmd type covering of the boost if you wish to remove them. All ultra boosts come with a torsion plate built into the sole, this helps with foot stability and arch stability. The upper is made from primeknit material, its super stretchy so there is no restriction to you feet at all, it has a sock like feel when the shoes are on feet, so much so you can forget you are wearing shoes! It is breathable but I do find my feet still get fairly hot inside these shoes. \\nThe colour of this shoe is a mix between blue and grey, and it has black peppered in throughout the primeknit with a black heel cap, black continental sole and a semi translucent cage. It is a stunning shoe, so much so I bought two pairs. \\nSizing - go true to size, do not size up as the primeknit upper is so stretchy the shoe will be too big. I&#39;m a UK 8.5 in women&#39;s and men&#39;s and the shoes fit perfectly, I can even fit an 8 quite happily due to the stretchy materials. Hope this helps',\n",
